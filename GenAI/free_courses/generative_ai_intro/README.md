## 💻 Mini-Project 1 (Build a GPT-3.5 backed Chatbot)

In this mini-project, you'll complete a 1 hour course from Deeplearning.AI that can help you build a chatbot that does the following
- Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Python

The course is completely free for everyone to take. Please find it [here](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)

Happy coding!!
