# Exploring the Faiss Library

[Faiss](https://faiss.ai/) or Facebook AI Similarity Search was built out of FB Engineering and is a library used to build an index of dense vectors and search, at scale.

The following is a sentence embedding exercise exploring the library courtesy of the folks at [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/product/), a commercial provider of fully mananged vector databases.

[Sentence embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_embedding) is a way to tokenize or numerically represent sentences, as vectors. Its applications in natural language include knowledge databases that could be queried against through the use of vector indexing for search.  [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is one good example of such an application - it was developed in Q4 2022 just last year as an open source project.

Similarity Search itself is a complex topic however there is a rich set of writings online - here is a [link to a good starter series](https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-knn-inverted-file-index-7cab80cc0e79) for those curious.

In the exercise, the embeddings are built using the [BERT Library](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/)
