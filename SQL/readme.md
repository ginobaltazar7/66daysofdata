# Jobs

Jobs data from an American Community Survey on job outcome statistics based on college majors loaded into a SQLite database called 'jobs.db' in a single table named recent_grads.

Each row represents a major and each column gives us some information about that major. Link to the original dataset page via fivethirtyeight -> https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors
