# Jobs 

September 2020 

Jobs simple data analysis using Python and Sql from an American Community Survey on job outcome statistics based on college majors loaded into a `SQLite` database called `jobs.db` in a single table named recent_grads. 

Each row represents a major and each column gives us some information about that major. Link to the original dataset page via fivethirtyeight -> https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors
