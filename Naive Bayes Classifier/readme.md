# Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes models are a group of extremely fast and simple classification algorithms that are often suitable for datasets with many dimensions or features. Because they are so fast and have so few tunable parameters, they end up being very useful as a quick-and-dirty baseline for classification.

Naive Bayes tend to perform especially well in one of the following use cases:

- When the naive assumptions actually match the data (very rare in practice)
- For very well-separated categories, when model complexity is less important
- For very high-dimensional data, when model complexity is less important
