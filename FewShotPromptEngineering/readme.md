# Exploring Few-Shot Prompt Engineering 

[Few-Shot Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) is a way of guiding a natural language processing model to respond through examples.

The technique's basis comes from the tendency of AI models to perform Similarity Searches, a complex topic which I covered lightly in [Faiss Vectors](https://github.com/ginobaltazar7/66daysofdata/tree/master/FaissVectorDB). In case you missed it, here is a [link to a good starter series](https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-knn-inverted-file-index-7cab80cc0e79) for those curious.
