# Natural Language Processing

Bag of words is a Natural Language Processing technique of representing text through systematic extraction and encoding of its feature outlines.

One of the biggest problems with text is that it is messy and unstructured, and machine learning algorithms prefer structured, well defined fixed-length inputs and by using the Bag-of-Words technique we can convert variable-length texts into fixed-length vectors.

One caveat - bag of words representation doesn’t consider the semantic relation between words. Generally the neighbor words in a sentence, context in other words, should be useful for predicting your target word.
