# Speech Recognition

Short demo of how to use NVIDIA NeMo (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) to swap a voice in the audio fragment with a computer generated one.

At its core the demo does:

- Automatic speech recognition of what is said in the file, e.g. converting audio to text
- Adds punctuation and capitalization to the text
- Generates spectrogram from resulting text
- Generates waveform audio from the spectrogram.
