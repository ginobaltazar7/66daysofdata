# Regression

Regression conceptually is simply estimating the best fit line mathematically through the classic 'y=mx+b' linear function. The following example experiments creating a deep learning regression model to predicting human weight given human height, first using Tensorflow then comparing its performance to scikit-learning's library.

As with any technique, training a deep learning model might not be the best choice every time from the results.
