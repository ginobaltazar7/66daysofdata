# 66daysofdata

In support of the #66daysofdata initiative and the data science community, this repo is a collection of (almost) daily data engineering and data science code and experiments for 66 days+.  

*"Why 66 days?  Because it is the average amount of days needed to establish a new habit. Creating solid data science habits is one of the most powerful things we can do to have longevity in this every dynamic field of technology. (Ken Jee)"*
