# Simple Vector Database

A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store, and manage large collections of vectors - which is an ordered list of elements that can represent or encode data that requires 2+ variables for its measurement.

Contrast this with 'scalars' which requires only one type of variable for its measurement.

When we say that a sailboat traveled for 2 miles upwind, we are describing its movement in a scalar way.

But when we say that a sailboat traveled for 2 miles downwind, 10 degrees northeast from its initial position, we are describing its movement in a vectorized way - it has magnitude and direction.

Vectors are important in data science and machine learning because they allow us to represent complex data in a more representative, useful and structured way.

So-called 'feature vectors' are used widely in machine learning because of the effectiveness and practicality of representing objects in a numerical way to help with many kinds of analyses. They are good for analysis because there are many techniques for comparing feature vectors, using for example cosine similarity, the dot product of vector magnitudes, or Euclidean distance, a measure of how close or far two points are in vectors space.
