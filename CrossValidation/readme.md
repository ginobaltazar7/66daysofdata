# Cross Validation

 Cross validation is a technique for evaluating machine learning models by training several the models on segments of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary other segments of the data. 

It is an effective technique. It helps us better use our data, yields more information about algorithm performance, and helps avoid overfitting, or the curse of [over-optimization](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63968/optimization-the-root-of-all-evil-in-statistics). 


"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
-Donald Knuth
