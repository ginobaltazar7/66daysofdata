# Gelato Conjoint Analysis

Conjoint analysis approximates the relationship between a product's attributes and their value or importance to the overall product, in this case, of gelato, one of my favorite desserts and which originated in Italy.

At its heart, the computation of product feature utility is mathematically a regression. In simple terms, linear regression can be applied to the dataset's dummy variables against a product rank or rating or customer preference for those features.
